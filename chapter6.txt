///this chapter is about structure as a data type
Notes:
-----
        ///structures definition

1- struct, an ordinary variable, member can have the same name
2- declare variables during define the struct >> struct Struct{} x, y, z;
3- struct declaration is not followed by a sequence of variables does not reserve any storage
4- structures may not be compared

     /// structures and functions

1- (), [], -> have the highest precedence operators
2- we use pointers to struct to avoid the cost of coping it when pass them to functions

    ///arrays of structures
1- array of structs like any other data type

    ///self referential structure
1- using the struct itself as a parameter in its declaration ex: struct K{struct K k1;};
2- in this part he talk about binary search tree to sort unexpected sequence of words lexicographically
    bst(all children nodes left to the parent are less than the parent and all children nodes right to the parent are equal or greater than the parent)
